## cool stuff im working on

- **[wahoo](https://github.com/sparkhere-sys/wahoo/)**: a simple, lightweight AUR helper written in python. you can also call it yaAURh because its yet another AUR helper
- **[archapt](https://github.com/sparkhere-sys/archapt/)**: a wrapper for `pacman` that pretends that its `apt`, written in bash. if you're feeling adventurous, install it as `dnf`. go ahead, i dare you.
