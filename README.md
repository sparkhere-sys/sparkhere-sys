i'm a wannabe programmer, and a professional dumbass

check out my [website](https://sparkhere-sys.github.io) ig

## some programming languages i know
- python
- bash scripting (its a shell scripting language and not a programming language, i know, but its close enough)
  
yeah uh

thats really it

## languages i want to learn
- java (because minecraft)
- kotlin (because its java but better)
- rust (because why not)

## languages i don't want to learn
- C++ (screw c++)
- C (because no OOP)

## cool stuff im working on

- **[wahoo](https://github.com/sparkhere-sys/wahoo/)**: a simple, lightweight AUR helper written in python. you can also call it yaAURh because its yet another AUR helper
- **[archapt](https://github.com/sparkhere-sys/archapt/)**: a wrapper for `pacman` that pretends that its `apt`, written in bash. if you're feeling adventurous, install it as `dnf`. go ahead, i dare you.
- **[bolt](https://github.com/sparkhere-sys/bolt/)**: a discord bot i wrote in python. ya gotta self host it though.

## personal stuff

i started programming when i was 6 years old, with good ol' scratch. my account is still on scratch to this day, check it out: [click me](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/7xel_Official)

nothing's changed since then! i'm still a programmer, always was, always will be.
